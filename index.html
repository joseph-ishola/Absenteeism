        <h1>Predicting Excessive Absenteeism in the Workplace</h1>
        <p>A comprehensive analysis using logistic regression</p>
    </header>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to predict excessive absenteeism in the workplace using machine learning techniques. We define "excessive absenteeism" as being absent for 4 or more hours, which is equivalent to taking half a day off. By identifying factors that contribute to excessive absenteeism, employers can develop targeted strategies to address underlying issues and improve workplace wellbeing.</p>
        
        <p>Excessive absenteeism represents a significant challenge for organizations, affecting productivity, team dynamics, and operational costs. Through data-driven insights, we can better understand the patterns and predictors of absenteeism, enabling more effective preventive measures and management strategies.</p>

        <h2>1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>We began by loading the dataset and examining its basic characteristics to gain insights into the data structure and identify potential issues that might affect our modeling.</p>
        
        <h3>Dataset Overview</h3>
        <p>The dataset contains information about employee absenteeism, including various factors that might contribute to an employee being absent from work. Our initial exploration revealed the following:</p>
        
        <div id="dataOverview"></div>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <p>The dataset includes the following key features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reason for Absence</strong>: Various reasons categorized into four types:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reason Type 1: Related to illness with medical certificates</li>
                    <li>Reason Type 2: Related to medical consultations and examinations</li>
                    <li>Reason Type 3: Related to serious health conditions requiring hospitalization</li>
                    <li>Reason Type 4: Related to personal circumstances (e.g., family matters)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Date</strong>: Timestamp of the absence record (later engineered into Month and Day of the Week)</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation Expense</strong>: Cost of transportation to work</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to Work</strong>: Distance from residence to workplace in kilometers</li>
            <li><strong>Age</strong>: Age of the employee</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Work Load Average</strong>: Average amount of work per day in minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Body Mass Index</strong>: Body mass index of the employee</li>
            <li><strong>Education</strong>: Education level:
                <ul>
                    <li>Originally encoded as 1: High School, 2: Graduate, 3: Postgraduate, 4: Masters/PhD.</li>
                    <li>To simplify the data and highlight education's impact on absenteeism, we engineered it into a binary variable:
						<ul>
							<li>High school (1) was mapped to 0.</li>
							<li>Graduate, Postgraduate, and Masters/PhD (2, 3, 4) were mapped to 1.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Children</strong>: Number of children</li>
            <li><strong>Pets</strong>: Number of pets</li>
            <li><strong>Absenteeism Time in Hours</strong>: Time of absence in hours (our target feature for prediction)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Distribution of Absenteeism Hours</h3>
        <p>Understanding the distribution of absenteeism hours is crucial for setting an appropriate threshold for "excessive" absence. The histogram below shows the distribution of absenteeism time in hours:</p>
        
        <div class="viz-container">
            <div class="viz-item">
                <h4>Distribution of Absenteeism Hours</h4>
                <div id="distributionPlot"></div>
                <p>The distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, with most absences being relatively short. This pattern is typical for absence data, where brief absences are common, and extended absences are comparatively rare. The median value is approximately 4 hours, which we used as our threshold for defining excessive absenteeism.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Missing Values Analysis</h3>
        <p>We checked for missing values in the dataset to ensure data completeness. Any missing values would need to be handled appropriately during the preprocessing stage.</p>
        
        <div id="missingValues"></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>We performed several feature engineering steps to prepare the data for modeling:</p>
        
        <h3>Categorical Features Transformation</h3>
        <p>We transformed categorical features to make them more suitable for our model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reason for Absence</strong>: We categorized the reasons into four types and created binary indicator variables (Reason Type 1, Reason Type 2, Reason Type 3, Reason Type 4). This transformation allows for better representation of different types of absences while avoiding multicollinearity issues</li>
            <li><strong>Date</strong>: We extracted the Month and Day of the Week from the date field to capture temporal patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Education</strong>: The Education column was mapped into a binary class (0 and 1), where:
				<ul>
					<li>0 represents employees with only a high school education.</li>
					<li>1 represents employees with higher education levels (Graduate, Postgraduate, Masters, or PhD).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
        
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre>
# Create reason type dummy variables
reason_columns = pd.get_dummies(data['Reason for Absence'], dtype=int, drop_first=True)

# Group reasons into categories and create aggregated type columns
data['Reason_Type_1'] = reason_columns.iloc[:, 1:14].sum(axis=1)
data['Reason_Type_2'] = reason_columns.iloc[:, 15:17].sum(axis=1)
data['Reason_Type_3'] = reason_columns.iloc[:, 18:21].sum(axis=1)
data['Reason_Type_4'] = reason_columns.iloc[:, 22:].sum(axis=1)

# Extract month and day of week from date
def extract_month(x):
    return x.month
	
data['Month Value'] = data['Date'].apply(extract_month)

def extract_day_of_week(x):
    return x.day_of_week
	
data['Day of the Week'] = data['Date'].apply(extract_day_of_week)

# Group Education into binary class
data['Education'] = data_mod['Education'].map({1:0, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1})
</pre>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Target Variable Creation</h3>
        <p>We created a binary target variable called <code>"Excessive absence"</code> to represent excessive absenteeism, based on the median value of absence hours:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If "Absenteeism time in hours" < 4, then "Excessive absence" = 0 (Not excessive)</li>
            <li>If "Absenteeism time in hours" â‰¥ 4, then "Excessive absence" = 1 (Excessive)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This approach ensures a balanced dataset with roughly equal numbers of each class, which is beneficial for logistic regression modeling.</p>
        
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre>
# Create binary target variable based on median threshold
median_absence = data['Absenteeism time in hours'].median()  # 4 hours
data['Excessive absence'] = (data['Absenteeism time in hours'] >= 4).astype(int)
</pre>

                <h4>Distribution of Excessive Absence Classes</h4>
                <div id="classDistribution"></div>
                <p>The class distribution shows the balance between "not excessive" (0) and "excessive" (1) absence cases in our dataset. Using the median as a threshold helps ensure a balanced dataset.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Correlation Analysis</h3>
        <p>We analyzed the correlations between numerical features to identify potential relationships and predictive features:</p>

                <h4>Correlation Matrix</h4>
                <div id="correlationMatrix"></div>
                <p>The correlation matrix highlights relationships between different features. Strong correlations (positive or negative) can indicate important predictive relationships or potential multicollinearity issues.</p>

        <p>Before building our model, we needed to prepare the data appropriately. This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.</p>
        
        <h3>Preprocessing Pipeline</h3>
        <p>We created a preprocessing pipeline to ensure consistent data transformation for both training and future prediction data:</p>
        
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Separate features and target
X = data.drop(['Excessive absence', 'Absenteeism time in hours', 'Date', 'Reason for Absence'], axis=1)
y = data['Excessive absence']

# Identify categorical and numerical features
categorical_features = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist()
numerical_features = X.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()

# Create preprocessing pipelines for both numerical and categorical data
numerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

if categorical_features:
    categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
        ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
        ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
    ])
    
    # Combine preprocessing steps
    preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
        transformers=[
            ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_features),
            ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
        ])
else:
    # If no categorical features, use only numerical transformer
    preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
        transformers=[
            ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_features)
        ])</code></pre>
        
        <h3>Data Splitting</h3>
        <p>We split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets to properly evaluate our model's performance:</p>
        
        <pre><code class="language-python">X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)</code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Model Building</h2>
        <p>We chose logistic regression as our classification model due to its interpretability and efficiency. Logistic regression is particularly suitable for binary classification problems like predicting excessive absenteeism.</p>
        
        <h3>Model Pipeline</h3>
        <p>We created a complete pipeline that combines preprocessing and the logistic regression model:</p>
        
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre>
model = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000))
])

model.fit(X_train, y_train)</pre>
        </div>
        
        <p>Using a pipeline ensures that all preprocessing steps are consistently applied to both training and test data, reducing the risk of data leakage and making the model more robust.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Feature Selection Based on Coefficients</h2>
        <p>After training the initial model, we performed feature selection based on the logistic regression coefficients. This step is crucial for improving model interpretability and potentially enhancing performance by focusing on the most significant predictors.</p>
        
        <h3>Coefficient Analysis</h3>
        <p>We extracted the coefficients from the trained model to evaluate the importance of each feature:</p>

# Get feature names after preprocessing

    categorical_feature_names = encoder.get_feature_names_out(categorical_features)
    feature_names = numerical_features + list(categorical_feature_names)

# Extract coefficients
coefficients = model.named_steps['classifier'].coef_[0]
odds_ratios = np.exp(coefficients)

        <h3>Interpretation of Coefficients</h3>
        <p>The coefficient values provide insights into the impact of each feature on the likelihood of excessive absenteeism:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive Coefficients</strong>: Features with positive coefficients increase the probability of excessive absenteeism. Higher coefficients indicate a stronger positive relationship.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Coefficients</strong>: Features with negative coefficients decrease the probability of excessive absenteeism.</li>
            <li><strong>Odds Ratio</strong>: The exponential of the coefficient represents how much the odds of excessive absenteeism change with a one-unit increase in the feature. An odds ratio > 1 indicates increased odds, while < 1 indicates decreased odds.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Feature Selection Decision</h3>
        <p>Based on the coefficient analysis, we made informed decisions about feature selection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We identified that <strong>Reason Type 3</strong> (serious health conditions requiring hospitalization) and <strong>Reason Type 1</strong> (illness with medical certificates) are the strongest predictors of excessive absenteeism, with odds ratios of 22.13 and 16.47 respectively.</li>
            <li>Features with coefficients close to zero (e.g., <strong>Daily Work Load Average</strong> with coefficient -0.000077) have minimal impact on the prediction and could potentially be removed.</li>
            <li>Some features with relatively small negative coefficients, such as <strong>Pets</strong> (-0.285729), <strong>Education</strong> (-0.206027), and <strong>Age</strong> (-0.165545), were evaluated for potential removal.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The final model retained features with significant predictive power while removing those with minimal impact to create a more parsimonious and interpretable model.</p>

        <h3>Interpretation of Key Factors</h3>
        <div id="featureInterpretation">
            <p>Based on our model, the following factors have the strongest influence on excessive absenteeism:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reason Type 3 (Serious health conditions)</strong>: With the highest coefficient (3.10) and odds ratio (22.13), serious health conditions requiring hospitalization are the strongest predictor of excessive absenteeism. This makes intuitive sense, as such conditions typically require longer recovery periods.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Reason Type 1 (Illness with medical certificates)</strong>: With a coefficient of 2.80 and odds ratio of 16.47, documented illnesses are the second strongest predictor. This indicates that formally recognized medical conditions significantly increase the likelihood of longer absences.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Reason Types 2 & 4</strong>: Medical consultations/examinations and personal matters also positively predict excessive absences, but with lower magnitudes (odds ratios of 2.54 and 2.36 respectively).</li>
                
                <li><strong>Transportation Expense</strong>: With a coefficient of 0.61 and odds ratio of 1.85, higher transportation costs are associated with increased likelihood of excessive absence. This may reflect longer commutes or more complicated travel arrangements, which could make attendance more challenging.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Children</strong>: Having more children (coefficient 0.36, odds ratio 1.44) is associated with increased likelihood of excessive absence, potentially due to childcare responsibilities and children's illnesses.</li
				
				<li><strong>Body Mass Index</strong>: Higher BMI (coefficient 0.27, odds ratio 1.31) correlates with increased likelihood of excessive absences. This aligns with medical research linking higher BMI to various health issues that might necessitate absence.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Month Value</strong>: With a coefficient of 0.17 and odds ratio of 1.18, this suggests a slight seasonal effect, with later months in the year showing slightly increased probability of excessive absence.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Education</strong>: Having higher education levels (coefficient -0.21, odds ratio 0.81) is associated with decreased likelihood of excessive absence. This could reflect different job roles, health awareness, or workplace attitudes associated with education level.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Age</strong>: Interestingly, increasing age has a negative coefficient (-0.17, odds ratio 0.85), suggesting that older employees are actually less likely to have excessive absences. This contradicts some common assumptions but might reflect greater job commitment or responsibility associated with age.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Pets</strong>: Having more pets (coefficient -0.29, odds ratio 0.75) is associated with decreased likelihood of excessive absence. This unexpected finding might reflect lifestyle factors or could be a statistical artifact.</li>

        <h2>8. Probability Predictions</h2>
        <p>Beyond binary classification, our logistic regression model can provide probability estimates for each prediction. These probabilities represent the model's confidence in classifying an absence as excessive or not.</p>
        
        <h3>Probability Distribution</h3>
        <p>The distribution of predicted probabilities gives us insight into the model's decision-making process:</p>
        
        <div class="viz-container">
            <div class="viz-item">
                <h4>Distribution of Predicted Probabilities</h4>
                <div id="probabilityDistribution"></div>
                <p>The histogram shows the distribution of predicted probabilities for excessive absenteeism. The bimodal distribution suggests that the model is often confident in its predictions, with fewer borderline cases.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
		<p>Based on the distribution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The modelâ€™s prediction probabilities form two distinct peaks (bimodal).</li>
			<li>It usually predicts very high (close to 1) or very low (close to 0) probabilities.</li>
            <li>There are fewer cases where the model is unsure (i.e., probabilities close to 0.5).</li>
            <li>This suggests the model is confident in its classifications.</li>
        </ul>
		
        <h3>Probability Thresholds</h3>
        <p>While we used the standard 0.5 threshold for classification, adjusting this threshold allows for different trade-offs between precision and recall:</p>
        
        <div class="viz-container">
            <div class="viz-item">
                <h4>Precision-Recall Trade-off</h4>
                <div id="precisionRecallCurve"></div>
                <p>This curve illustrates how precision and recall change with different probability thresholds. Organizations can choose a threshold that aligns with their specific goalsâ€”whether prioritizing catching all cases of excessive absenteeism (high recall) or ensuring high confidence in predictions (high precision).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Based on our analysis, we recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For general purposes: Use the default 0.5 threshold, which balances precision and recall.</li>
            <li>For preventive programs targeting at-risk employees: Consider lowering the threshold to 0.4 to catch more potential cases (higher recall).</li>
            <li>For resource-intensive interventions: Consider raising the threshold to 0.6 to focus on high-confidence cases (higher precision).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Limitations and Future Work</h2>
        <p>While our model provides valuable insights, it's important to acknowledge its limitations and identify opportunities for future improvement.</p>
        
        <h3>Current Limitations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Limited Feature Set</strong>: The current model relies on a relatively small set of features. Many other factors that might influence absenteeism (e.g., job satisfaction, workplace culture, specific health conditions) were not included in the dataset.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Static Snapshot</strong>: The analysis represents a static snapshot in time rather than tracking trends over extended periods. Temporal patterns beyond month of the year may be missed.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Binary Classification</strong>: By transforming the problem into binary classification (excessive vs. not excessive), we've simplified the problem but may have lost nuance in predicting actual hours of absence.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Causality Not Established</strong>: While we identified correlations between features and excessive absenteeism, the model does not establish causality. Some relationships might be indirect or influenced by unmeasured confounding variables.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Limited Contextual Understanding</strong>: The model doesn't account for workplace-specific contexts or industry-specific factors that might influence absenteeism patterns.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Future Work</h3>

        <h2>12. Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion-card">
            <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
            <p>This project successfully developed a predictive model for excessive absenteeism with 75% accuracy. We identified several key factors that influence excessive absenteeism, with serious health conditions and documented illnesses being the strongest predictors.</p>
            
            <p>Other significant factors included transportation expenses, having children, and BMI, all of which were positively associated with excessive absence. Interestingly, factors like age and education level showed negative associations, suggesting that older and more educated employees are less likely to have excessive absences.</p>
            
            <p>The model not only provides binary predictions but also probability estimates that can be used to identify employees at various risk levels, enabling targeted interventions based on organizational priorities and resource constraints.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="conclusion-card">
            <h3>Business Value</h3>
            <p>The predictive model and insights derived from this analysis offer significant business value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proactive Management</strong>: Rather than reacting to absence patterns after they occur, organizations can take preventive measures based on risk predictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Optimization</strong>: By targeting interventions to employees at highest risk, organizations can allocate resources more efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Workforce Planning</strong>: Understanding the factors that contribute to absenteeism can inform staffing decisions and contingency planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Well-being</strong>: The insights can guide wellness programs and support services that address the root causes of absence, potentially improving employee health and satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Reduction</strong>: By reducing excessive absenteeism, organizations can minimize direct costs (temporary staffing, overtime) and indirect costs (reduced productivity, lower team morale).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="conclusion-card">
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Predicting and addressing excessive absenteeism requires a balanced approach that considers both organizational needs and employee well-being. While our model provides valuable insights, it should be used as one tool within a comprehensive absence management strategy that also includes supportive policies, health promotion, and attention to workplace culture.</p>
            
            <p>The most effective interventions will likely be those that view absence not merely as a problem to be minimized but as a signal of underlying issues that, when addressed, can lead to a healthier, more engaged, and ultimately more productive workforce.</p>
